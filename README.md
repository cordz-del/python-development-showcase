# Python Development Showcase

This repository demonstrates my Python development skills with clean code, modular design, and unit testing.

## Features
- Modular code structure
- Example functionality in `main.py`
- Unit tests in `tests/test_main.py`

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app: `python main.py`
3. Run tests: `pytest tests/`
